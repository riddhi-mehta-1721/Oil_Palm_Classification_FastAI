# Oil_Palm_Classification_FastAI
The aim of the project is to create a model that predicts the presence of oil palm plantations in satellite imagery. The dataset images are 3-meter spatial resolution, and each is labelled with whether an oil palm plantation appears in the image (0 for no plantation, 1 for any presence of a plantation).
